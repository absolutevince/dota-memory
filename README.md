# Dota Memory Game

A Memory/Card-Pairing game made with React + Tailwindcss

## How to play?
- Go to [Dota Memory](https://dota-memory.vercel.app/)

- The Game is fairly simple, click a face-down card and try to find it's pair 
- The lesser the attempt the better (failed and success pair are to be counted as an attempt)
- Each "Difficulty" has a different score



## What's the goal of this project?
This game is made as a project for The Odin Project, and the main goal is to be able comfortably use `useState` and `useEffect` hooks as these are the most used hooks in React. And also to better understand the Life-cycle of a Component and be able to use these hooks with lesser unnecessary bugs.
